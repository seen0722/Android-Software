# Android Software Owner — AI Agent Skill Set

> **Beta v0.5** — Phase 4 complete. Skills validated against Android 15 with A16 forward intelligence staged.
> See [How to Report Gaps](#reporting-gaps-and-feedback) to help improve this.

A **Hierarchical AI Agent Skill Set** for Android Software Owners and BSP engineers working with AOSP. Built on an **MMU-driven Memory Model** — the agent loads only the subsystem knowledge relevant to your current task, preventing context bloat and hallucinated paths across a 50M+ LOC codebase.

---

## Who Is This For?

- **Android Software Owners** managing platform integration across build, HAL, SELinux, init, framework, and kernel
- **BSP engineers** working with SoC-specific layers (LK/ABL bootloader, ATF/TF-A, vendor HALs, pKVM)
- **Platform engineers** handling Android version migrations (A14 → A15, 16KB page size, GKI compliance)
- Anyone who has been burned by an AI agent confidently citing the wrong AOSP path

---

## The Problem This Solves

Generic AI agents on AOSP produce three failure modes:

| Failure | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Hallucinated paths** | "Edit `system/core/services/FooService.java`" — that path doesn't exist |
| **Cross-domain confusion** | Routing a LK bootloader bug to `init`, or an ATF EL3 issue to the Linux kernel |
| **Knowledge drift** | Confidently describing Android 13 behavior on an Android 15 device |

This skill set fixes these by forcing the agent through a **Layer 1 router** that maps intent to verified AOSP paths, then loads the correct **Layer 2 expert** with subsystem-specific knowledge, forbidden actions, and tooling.

## Architecture

```

> ¹ Vendor-supplied paths — not in standard AOSP. Routing is by subsystem intent, not path presence.

## Device Profiles (L4 — grounding to a real board)

Beyond routing, the skill set can ground answers in **a specific product/SKU's real facts**, so the agent stops assuming generic AOSP. Facts live as layered data under `devices/`; a single generic `L4-device-grounding-expert` skill resolves and applies them.

- **Layered data** — `devices/<product>/` composes a profile from `base + os + hw + dist + customer` fragments via thin SKU recipes (no per-SKU duplication).
- **Source State as Truth** — before analyzing, `verify_source_state.py` confirms the synced tree matches the SKU. For `repo`-managed trees it compares the **manifest** (`default.xml` dev / pinned release); for plain git repos it compares the branch. Uncertainty → `UNVERIFIED`, never a wrong assumption.
- **Governance & isolation** — per-customer delivery branches, certification ownership, and cross-customer NDA isolation are enforced as forbidden actions.

Execution order is `L1 → L4 → L2/L3` — L4 is paged only when the task names a product / SKU / branch / customer.

First real product line: **`devices/thorpe-t70/`** (Trimble T70, QCS6490 / Kodiak, A/B, single unified manifest). See `devices/ONBOARDING.md` to add your own.

## Quickstart (5 minutes)

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) (recommended) or any AI agent that can load files from a local directory
- An AOSP workspace (or just the questions — the agent works without local source)

### Step 1: Clone

```bash
git clone <repo-url> Android-Software
cd Android-Software
```

### Step 2: Point your AI agent at the project

**With Claude Code:**
```bash
cd Android-Software
claude
```

Claude Code automatically reads `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` at startup — the routing system is live immediately.

**With any other AI agent:**
Load `AGENTS.md` as your system prompt, then load `skills/L1-aosp-root-router/SKILL.md`. The agent will request the correct L2 skill as needed.

### Step 3: Ask your first question

```
"I'm getting avc: denied { read } for my new vendor daemon on /data/vendor/foo/.
 What SELinux policy do I need?"
```

The agent routes to `L2-security-selinux-expert`, applies the forbidden-action guardrails, and gives you a path-scoped answer.

---

## BSP-Specific Setup

### Vendor Path Tuning

If your BSP places vendor trees at non-standard paths, update the L1 router's footnote entries:

```
skills/L1-aosp-root-router/SKILL.md  ← routing table
```

The default vendor path footnotes are:
- `bootloader/lk/` — Qualcomm ABL / little-kernel
- `atf/` or `arm-trusted-firmware/` — ARM TF-A
- `trusty/` — Trusty TEE

If your SoC uses different paths (e.g., `vendor/qcom/proprietary/abl/`), add a row to the mapping table pointing to your actual path and the same L2 skill.

### Adding Your Own Hindsight Notes

After solving a tricky BSP problem, record it:

```bash
# Create memory/hindsight_notes/HS-023_your_insight.md
# Follow the format of existing notes (HS-001 through HS-022)
```

These persist across sessions and teach the agent your platform's specific behavior.

### Marking Skills Dirty After a BSP Update

When you pull a new BSP drop or update your Android version:

```bash
# Auto-detect dirty skills from a git diff
git diff --name-only A14..A15 | python3 scripts/detect_dirty_pages.py --apply

# Generate a per-skill migration impact report
python3 scripts/migration_impact.py --from A14 --to A15

# Validate dirty_pages.json schema
python3 scripts/validate_dirty_pages.py

# Lint all SKILL.md files against the template schema
python3 scripts/skill_lint.py
```

The `detect_dirty_pages.py` script reads changed file paths, matches them against each skill's `path_scope`, and updates `memory/dirty_pages.json` automatically.
