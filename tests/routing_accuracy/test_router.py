"""
AOSP Root Router Accuracy Test Suite
=====================================
Tests the routing logic defined in skills/L1-aosp-root-router/SKILL.md.

Each test case represents a user task description and asserts:
  - The expected AOSP path(s) to be identified
  - The expected L2 skill to be loaded

Usage:
    python3 tests/routing_accuracy/test_router.py

Test suite: 110 cases (TC-001 – TC-110)
  - TC-001 – TC-026: Original single-skill cases (2 per skill, all 12 L2 skills)
  - TC-027 – TC-070: Additional single-skill cases (3-4 per skill)
  - TC-071 – TC-100: Multi-skill cross-domain scenarios (30 cases, ≥3-skill coverage)
  - TC-101 – TC-105: L3 OEM routing scenarios (Qualcomm kernel; Phase 6.1)
  - TC-106 – TC-110: L3 OEM routing scenarios (MediaTek kernel; Phase 6.2)

Phase 3 target: ≥95% routing accuracy on the full 100-case suite.

When a real router implementation exists, replace `mock_router()` with the
actual routing function. Until then, this file serves as the ground-truth
specification and can be used for manual spot-check evaluation.
